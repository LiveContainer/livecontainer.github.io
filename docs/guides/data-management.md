# Data Management

:::warning
Some actions are destructive. Back up important app/container data first.
:::

## Available tools

- clean unused data folders
- clean keychain
- move App Group folder between private and shared locations
- move dangling shared folders out
- clear icon cache

## Recommended usage

### Clean unused data folders

Use after deleting apps/containers to remove orphaned folders and reclaim space.

### Clean keychain

Use only when credential/keychain state is corrupted and other fixes failed.

### App Group migration actions

Use when shared/private storage state is mismatched due to install/path changes.

### Move dangling shared folders

Use when shared resources remain in wrong place after migration, reinstall, or interrupted operations.

## Safe procedure

1. Export logs.
2. Back up critical data.
3. Run one operation.
4. Relaunch and verify.
5. Repeat only if required.
