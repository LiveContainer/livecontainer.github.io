# JIT Support

LiveContainer integrates with multiple JIT enablers so you can run unsigned binaries on iOS 17.4–18.x and newer betas (including the iOS 26+ script workflow). Configure everything inside **Settings → JIT**.

## Mark apps that require JIT

1. Long-press an app → **Settings** → enable **Launch with JIT**.
2. Open LiveContainer, but do **not** trigger JIT yet.
3. Set up one of the enablers below.
4. Make sure the enabler’s prerequisites are satisfied (VPN/paired Mac/etc.).
5. Tap **Run** on the app. LiveContainer waits in a “Waiting for JIT” state until the enabler responds.
6. If the enabler cannot attach automatically, switch to it and trigger JIT manually while the prompt stays open.

## Built-in enablers

### StikDebug (formerly StikJIT, recommended)

[StikDebug](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stikdebug/id6744045754) provides the smoothest setup on iOS 17.4+ as well as the new iOS 26+ script import.

1. Install StikDebug and import the pairing file generated by AltStore/SideStore/AltServer.
2. In the app’s settings activate **Launch with JIT**.
3. Go to **Settings → JIT Enabler** and choose **StikDebug**. If you plan to use the iOS 26+ automation script, paste it into the provided field.
4. Launch the app. LiveContainer will request StikDebug to attach automatically. If the request fails, open StikDebug and press “Enable JIT for LiveContainer” while the prompt is visible.

### SideStore (0.6.2+)

SideStore exposes a JIT API that LiveContainer can call. Because the URL scheme does not yet return to LiveContainer automatically, you must finish the flow manually:

1. Select **SideStore** as your enabler.
2. When “Waiting for JIT” appears, switch to SideStore → **My Apps**.
3. Ensure SideStore’s VPN is connected (or Airplane Mode + Wi-Fi trick is active).
4. Long-press LiveContainer → **Enable JIT**. Return to LiveContainer once SideStore confirms success.

### SideJITServer

[SideJITServer](https://github.com/nythepegasus/SideJITServer) lets you run your own pairing server.

1. Deploy SideJITServer and note the HTTP endpoint plus your device UDID.
2. In LiveContainer enter the server address and UDID in **Settings → JIT Enabler → SideJITServer**.
3. Launch the app. LiveContainer will call your server automatically.

### AltStore/AltServer scripts

Recent builds include an automation slot where you can paste AltStore/AltServer JIT scripts (including iOS 26+ variants contributed by the community). These scripts usually expect the device to be on the same network as AltServer.

1. Copy the script from the AltStore Discord/wiki.
2. Paste it into the script field inside the JIT settings.
3. Run an app marked as “Launch with JIT.” LiveContainer will execute the script and display its output in the prompt.

## Troubleshooting

- Use the **JIT-Less Diagnose** page (Settings → JIT-Less Mode Diagnose) to verify certificates and keychain items before blaming JIT.
- If the waiting dialog dismisses immediately, confirm the enabler is selected and LiveContainer has permission to open its URL scheme.
- LiveContainer logs messages to `Settings → Data Management → Export Logs`; include them when reporting issues.
- Remember that multitasked windows require enablers that can attach by PID (StikDebug supports this; manual SideStore enabling does not).
