# Other Questions

## 8.1. Behavior Modifying Features
LiveContainer's primary goal is to run apps as if they were sideloaded, without altering their intended functionality. Therefore, feature requests that modify an app’s behavior (e.g., network monitoring, disabling functions) will not be considered. However, community contributions for these types of features are welcome.

## 8.2. App Crash / Malfunction Due to the Need of Entitlements Only Available to Paid Developer Account
LiveContainer is designed to somewhat bypass the 3 app limit set on free developer accounts. App crash / malfunction due to the need of entitlements only available to paid developer account (e.g., push notifications, Siri, iCloud) will not be fixed.

## 8.3. UI Beautifying / Customization Features
Requests for features like home page customization, changing app names/icons, and other visual adjustments are low priority since they are not quite useful and can potentially slow down app launch times. You can simply create a shortcut in your home screen and change how they are ordered and their name / icon.

## 8.4. About Games
Game crashes are among the most difficult to fix because games are often built with engines written in languages other than C, C++, Objective-C, or Swift. This makes it harder for us to identify the root cause. Therefore, please keep expectations low regarding fixes for game-related issues.

Additionally, we do not provide support for game cheating, cracking, or hack clients. Any issue about game cheating will be immediately closed. Please use the official game client or other sideloading methods.
