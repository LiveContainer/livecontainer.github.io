# 8. Will Feature X be Implemented? When will Feature X be Implemented? 
## 8.1. Behavior Modifying Features
LiveContainer's primary goal is to run apps as if they were sideloaded, without altering their intended functionality. Therefore, feature requests that modify an app’s behavior (e.g., network monitoring, disabling functions) will not be considered. However, community contributions for these types of features are welcome.

## 8.2. App Crash / Malfunction Due to the Need of Entitlements Only Available to Paid Developer Account
LiveContainer is designed to somewhat bypass the 3 app limit set on free developer accounts. App crash / malfunction due to the need of entitlements only available to paid developer account (e.g., push notifications, Siri, iCloud) will not be fixed.

## 8.3. UI Beautifying / Customization Features
Requests for features like home page customization, changing app names/icons, and other visual adjustments are low priority since they are not quite useful and can potentially slow down app launch times. You can simply create a shortcut in your home screen and change how they are ordered and their name / icon.

## 8.4. Upcoming Features
The following features are likely to be added to LiveContainer.
- Install app from URL & app install URL (eta 3.3.0)
- 3+ containers for each app (eta when SideStore 0.6.0 release)
- ADP certificate support (eta when I get an ADP certificate for free)
