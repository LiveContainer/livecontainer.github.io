# LiveContainer Introduction

An app launcher that runs iOS apps without actually installing them!

- LiveContainer is an app launcher (not emulator or hypervisor) that allows you to run iOS apps inside it.
- Allows you to install unlimited apps (3 app/10 app id free developer account limit does not apply here!), and have multiple versions of an app installed with multiple data containers.
- (iOS 18 and below) When JIT is available, codesign is entirely bypassed, no need to sign your apps before installing. Otherwise, app will be signed with the same certificate used by LiveContainer.

## Features
